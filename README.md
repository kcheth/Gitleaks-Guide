# Gitleaks
As DevOps engineers, we recognize the significance of maintaining the security and integrity of our code repositories. A crucial aspect of securing a codebase involves ensuring that sensitive information, including passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, or any suspicious file names, is not inadvertently committed.

## What is Gitleaks?
Gitleaks is an open-source tool designed to detect and prevent secret passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, and more in your code repository. It scans your code repository for sensitive information that may have been accidentally committed. These secrets could include passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, suspicious file names, or file extensions like id_rsa, .pem, and htpasswd.

## How does Gitleaks Work?
Gitleaks functions by inspecting your code repository for files that conform to predefined patterns. These patterns are crafted to identify different types of sensitive information like passwords, secrets, key files, and more. Upon discovering a match, Gitleaks issues an alert, enabling you to take necessary measures to eliminate the identified sensitive information.
